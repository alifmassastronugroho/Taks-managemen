# Day 4: Version Control & Collaboration

## Overview
Today we'll integrate Git version control into our project and learn about collaboration workflows. We'll set up proper Git practices, create meaningful commit history, and implement collaboration features.

## Learning Goals
- Initialize Git repository with proper structure
- Create meaningful commit messages and history
- Implement branching strategies
- Set up collaboration workflows
- Add code review processes
- Create documentation for team collaboration

## Key Concepts
- **Version Control**: Tracking changes to code over time
- **Git Workflow**: Structured approach to using Git
- **Branching Strategy**: Organizing development with branches
- **Code Review**: Peer review process for quality assurance
- **Collaboration**: Working effectively in teams
- **Documentation**: Clear instructions for team members

## Files Created Today
- `.gitignore` - Files to exclude from version control
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Team behavior guidelines
- `git-workflow-guide.md` - Git workflow documentation
- `collaboration-features.js` - Team collaboration functionality
- `code-review-checklist.md` - Review process guidelines
- `team-setup-guide.md` - Setup instructions for new team members

## Git Workflow Implementation
1. **Repository Setup**: Initialize with proper structure
2. **Branching Strategy**: Feature branches and main branch protection
3. **Commit Standards**: Conventional commit messages
4. **Code Review**: Pull request process
5. **Collaboration Tools**: Team communication features

## Best Practices Introduced
- Meaningful commit messages
- Feature branch workflow
- Code review process
- Documentation standards
- Team communication protocols
- Conflict resolution strategies
